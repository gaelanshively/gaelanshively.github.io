      <h2><a href="https://github.com/WCCI-TimeTo/TimeTo">TimeTo</a></h2>
      <p>
        TimeTo is a calendar API that stores a user's schedule so that our single page application can compare it to the
        user's friends, making it easier to find common free time to make plans by highlighting days when you each have
        free time.
        This project was built entirely via remote collaboration, relying heavily on the use of our scrum board and
        regular stand-ups.
        This created unique challenges for our team, and therefore gave us unique ways to grow as developers.

      <h2><a href="https://github.com/2020-Spring-Cohort/clicking-calamity-gaelanshively">The Summoning</a></h2>
      <p>
        My first foray into JavaScript, this is a click counter game modeled after <a
          href="https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/">Cookie Clicker</a> and built with a Lovecraftian cosmic
        horror theme.
        Tested with Jasmine.

      <h2><a href="https://github.com/2020-Spring-Cohort/reviews-site-cupcakes">Potato Party!</a></h2>
      <p>
        Dynamic website created as a team using scrum and extensive testing, allowing users to write reviews of
        potatoes.
        Sortable by category or hashtag, uses Spring and Thymeleaf to create pages as users enter new reviews.
        Used H2 database to store reviews entered by users.

      <h2><a href="https://github.com/2020-Spring-Cohort/artists-albums-songs-team">Heavy Metal API</a></h2>
      <p>
        This song information API was created as part of a team to store information on heavy metal artists, albums and
        songs to be displayed on a single-page application.
        We tested with JUnit for the back-end and Jasmine for the front-end.

      <h2><a href="https://github.com/gaelanshively/high-st-hospital-gaelanshively">High St Hospital</a></h2>
      <p>Terminal-based Java application using a group of hash maps to simulate a hospital with various staff members
        and patients.
        Used superclasses and interfaces to enable doctors and nurses to perform the same tasks with different results,
        and to prevent janitors and other maintenance staff from providing medical support.</p>
      <br>
      <h2><a href="https://github.com/2020-Spring-Cohort/virtual-pets-amok-cfgi">Virtual Pets Amok</a></h2>
      <p>This terminal-based application simulated a pet shelter, with options to feed, play with, clean, and rescue
        organic and robotic pets. It was my first program in Java and the first program in any language in about 16
        years.
        Created as part of a team using agile methods and TDD.
        Used superclasses and subclasses to distinguish functions between robotic and organic pets, and to differentiate
        results between cats and dogs.</p>
