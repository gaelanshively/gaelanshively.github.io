    <h2>Gaelan Shively</h2>
    <section class=aboutme>
    <p>I am a Columbus native who grew up fascinated by technology. 
    From obsessively fighting my way through Nintendo games to writing stories on my Apple II which my cousins voraciously consumed, I spent much of my childhood in front of a screen. 
    In high school I taught myself some limited Visual Basic and Java but struggled to find helpful resources on this.</p>

    <p>When I started college, I excitedly declared a major in Computer Information Technologies, but quickly found that I already knew the things they were covering. 
    In my youthful impatience I switched majors and have regretted it ever since. 
    I convinced myself it was too late for me to go back and learn software development, though I often dreamt of it.</p>

    <p>Finally, I had enough of boring jobs that neither challenged me nor made use of my skills and decided to enroll in WeCanCodeIT and get back on the path I have wanted to walk all this time. 
    I am now looking forward to getting started using my skills to provide for my wife and our obese cats.</p>
