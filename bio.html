      <h2>About Me</h2>

    <div class="grid-three">
      <p>I am a Columbus native who grew up fascinated by technology.
          From obsessively fighting my way through Nintendo games to writing stories on my Apple II which my cousins
          voraciously consumed, I spent much of my childhood in front of a screen.
          In high school I taught myself some limited Visual Basic and Java but struggled to find helpful resources on
          this.</p>

      <p>When I started college, I excitedly declared a major in Computer Information Technologies, but quickly found
          that I already knew the things they were covering.
          In my youthful impatience I switched majors and have regretted it ever since.
          I convinced myself it was too late for me to go back and learn software development, though I often dreamt
          of it.</p>

      <p>Finally, I had enough of boring jobs that neither challenged me nor made use of my skills and decided to
          enroll in WeCanCodeIT and get back on the path I have wanted to walk all this time.
          I am now looking forward to getting started using my skills to provide for my wife and our adorably obese
          cats.</p>
